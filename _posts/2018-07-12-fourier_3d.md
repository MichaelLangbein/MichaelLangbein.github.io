motivation
	fft: like dive, manipulate and dive up again
	expl: octave to music. what does it mean to add an octave to a ball?

Intro:
	fft: 
		t = [0 + deltat]
		x = signal(t)
		plot(t, x)
		a = fft(x)
		a' = addOctave(a)
		x' = ifft(a')
		plot(t, x')

in 3d
	how?
		t = [0 + deltaap], where deltaap = (deltaPhi, deltaRho)  (ap=angular position)
		sig = signal(t)
		a = fft(sig) = ( fft(sig_x), fft(sig_y), fft(sig_z) )
	why?
		simplest approach
		there is a vector space where scalars and vectors are the same thing
		that is geometric algebra
		there is also a fft for nvector-samples defined
		if the nvector-sample consists of scalar-only-nvectors, it reduces to fft
		it the nvector-sample consists of vector-only-nvectors, it reduces to [fft_x, fft_y, fft_z]

Example
	Code
	Plot

A note on sampling
	fft requires samples to be taken at regular intervals. 
	deltat is regular wrt time. consequently, the frequencies of fft are frequencies wrt time. 
	how is our deltaap regular? 
		it is regular with respect to angular position. consequently, the frequences of fft are also frequences wrt angular position. 
		if in 1d we did an octave as twice the frequency wrt time, 
		what would be twice the frequency wrt angular position?

A second note on sampling
	for fft to notice a wave with frequency f, that wave must have passed through at least twice. 
	thus, in our sphere, we need to have moved around the sphere at least twice.
