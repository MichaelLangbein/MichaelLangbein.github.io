This post is still in draft stage! I'll finish it up as soon as I find some time to write again.

# Motivation

With a $\code{unique_ptr}$ you can make sure that only one object, the owner of the pointer, can access the value behind the pointer. Consider this epic tale of a king and his magic sword: 

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>

using std::string;

class Weapon {
  private:
    string name;
  
  public:
    Weapon(string n = "rusty sword") : name(n) {
    
    }
    
    ~Weapon(){
      std::cout << name << " destroyed" << std::endl;
    }
    
    string getName() {
      return name;
    }
};

class Hero {
  private:
    string name;
    Weapon* weapon_ptr;
  
  public:
    Hero(string n) : name(n), weapon_ptr(nullptr) {}
    
    ~Hero(){
      if(weapon_ptr != nullptr){ 
        std::cout << name << " now destroying " << weapon_ptr->getName() << std::endl;
        delete weapon_ptr;
      }
      std::cout << name << " destroyed." << std::endl;
    }
    
    void pickUpWeapon(Weapon* w) {
      if(weapon_ptr != nullptr) delete weapon_ptr;
      weapon_ptr = w;
    }
    
    string describe() {
      if(weapon_ptr != nullptr){
        return name + " now swings " + weapon_ptr->getName();
      } else {
        return name + " now swings his bare hands";
      }
    }
};

Weapon* blacksmithForge(string name){
  Weapon* wp = new Weapon(name);
  return wp;
}


int main() {
  
  Hero arthur = Hero("Arthur");
  Hero mordred = Hero("Mordred");
  Weapon* excalibur = blacksmithForge("Excalibur");
  
  std::cout << arthur.describe() << std::endl;
  arthur.pickUpWeapon(excalibur);
  std::cout << arthur.describe() << std::endl;
  mordred.pickUpWeapon(excalibur);
  std::cout << mordred.describe() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Everything going out of scope." << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note how Mordred has snatched away Arthurs sword. When mordred dies, he takes Excalibur with him into the grave. When Arthur dies, he tries to do the same, but has to find that the sword he thought he had was no longer there. We can fix this problem by using $\code{unique_ptr}$'s:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>

using std::string;

class Weapon {
  private:
    string name;
  
  public:
    Weapon(string n = "rusty sword") : name(n) {};
    
    string getName() {
      return name;
    }
};

class Hero {
  private:
    string name;
    std::unique_ptr<Weapon> weapon_ptr;
  
  public:
    Hero(string n) : name(n), weapon_ptr(new Weapon(n + "'s bare hands")) {}
    
    void pickUpWeapon(std::unique_ptr<Weapon> w) {
      if(!w){
        std::cout << "Nothing to pick up." << std::endl;
        return;
      }
      weapon_ptr = std::move(w);
    }
    
    string describe() {
        return name + " now swings " + weapon_ptr->getName();
    }
};

std::unique_ptr<Weapon> blacksmithForge(string name){
  std::unique_ptr<Weapon> wp(new Weapon(name));
  return wp;
}


int main() {
  
  Hero arthur = Hero("Arthur");
  Hero mordred = Hero("Mordred");
  std::unique_ptr<Weapon> excalibur = blacksmithForge("Excalibur");
  
  std::cout << arthur.describe() << std::endl;
  arthur.pickUpWeapon(std::move(excalibur));
  std::cout << arthur.describe() << std::endl;
  
  std::cout << "Mordred now tries to snatch Excalibur." << std::endl;
  mordred.pickUpWeapon(std::move(excalibur));
  std::cout << mordred.describe() << std::endl;
  

  std::cout << "Everything going out of scope." << std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```




### Ownership: unique, shared and weak pointers

Let us explain in a bit more detail what a smart pointer is. Really, it i just a class encapsulating a raw pointer. The idea is that by wrapping a pointer in a class, we can have the class object be allocated on the stack and have it free the memory behind the pointer when the object is destroyed. This way, you don't have to manually delete a pointer.

```c++

class SmartPointer{
    private:
        T* ptr;
    public:
        SmartPointer(T* p){
            ptr = p;
        }
        ~SmartPointer(){
            free(ptr);
        }
}
```

In this example, we allocate Excalibur on the heap. But because we're using smart pointers, we never have to clean up memory manually:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

using std::string;

class Weapon{
  private:
    string name;
  public:
    Weapon(string n) : name(n){}
    string getName(){
      return name;
    }
    ~Weapon(){
      std::cout << name << " is being destroyed" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Hero{
  private:
    string name;
    std::unique_ptr<Weapon> weapon;
  public:
    Hero(string n) : name(n), weapon(new Weapon("rusty sword")) {}
    void pickWeapon(std::unique_ptr<Weapon> w){
      std::cout << name << " picked up " << w->getName() << std::endl;
      weapon = std::move(w);
      std::cout << weapon->getName()  << " is now on " << name << std::endl;
    }
    ~Hero(){
      std::cout << name << " is being destroyed" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
  
  Hero arthur("Arthur");
  std::unique_ptr<Weapon> w(new Weapon("Excalibur"));
  arthur.pickWeapon(std::move(w));
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note how we used $\code{move(w)}$ to overwrite $\code{weapon}$. What happens here is this: In the main-scope, the $\code{w}$'s internal pointer to Excalibur is replaced by a $\code{nullptr}$. Any further attempt of accessing $\code{w}$ will cause a runtime-error. Inside the $\code{pickWeapon}$ method, the old smartpointer to the rusty sword is destroyed, causing the sword itself to be free'd.  
We could'nt have used $\code{weapon = w;}$; that would have caused an error (because $\code{unique_ptr}$'s copy-assignment method is delted). This is deliberate: we don't want copies of a unique pointer to exist. We want a unique pointer to only ever exist in one place (in this case: first in the $\code{main}$ function, later in the $\code{arthur}$ instance), so that the memory behind the pointer can only get freed once (in this case: when $\code{arthur} $is destroyed).

Generally, we can proclaim the following rules:

    - When you're given a reference, someone else will clean up the original. 
    - When you're given a unique pointer, you are now the sole owner of the smartpointer. If you move the pointer, it will go out of scope once you do; if you don't, it will go out of scope once your method ends. Passing a unique pointer to a method that doesn't move the pointer means destroying the object! To pass a unique pointer to a method without it being destroyed or moved, don't pass the unique pointer, pass a $\code{unique_ptr<T> const &}$.
    - When you're given a shared pointer, ... . Shared pointers use reference counting just like the java garbage collector.
